                    What started as a class assignment grew into a design for an app that I wish existed. Flip! allows a user to dig themselves out of a show hole. Recommendations for new movies and shows would come from your closest friends and an algorithm that took every streaming service into account.

            <p class=roleInfo>The team consisted of 3 team members. From the get go it was important to each teammate that the work be distributed equally. This democratization ended up not only being beneficial to the individual, but to the work as well. We could each speak confidently about each step of the work. But most important of all this work flow allowed for mistakes to be caught almost immediately.

                Personally however, I took the lead on several aspects of the deliverables. Specifically all the writing; i.e. the problem statement and the conclusion. I also took charge of the storyboard, which was more fun than a chore. </p>
